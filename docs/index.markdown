My name is Karen Hancock I am a small hobby breeder based in Bristol. I am a committee member of [The Maine Coon Cat Club](http://www.maine-coon-cat-club.com/) and the Maine Coon BAC  (Breed advisory committee). I have been breeding these majestic cats since 2008. 

I am dedicated to breeding healthy, well socialized & confident maine coon kittens which are bred to breed standard. 
My cats / kittens are raised in a home environment – here they are lavished with the upmost care love and attention.

My cattery is registered with [GCCF](https://www.gccfcats.org/) & [TICA](https://tica.org) 

All of my breeding cats have been health tested and are clear from HCM, SMA, PKdef, PKD & FELV/FIV. 
This is very important to me, being qualified veterinary nurse for more than 20 years. I am now sadly retired.
