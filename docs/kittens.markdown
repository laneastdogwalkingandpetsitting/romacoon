### Neutering

Kittens will all be neutered before sale - all kittens sold for pets will be neutered before leaving Romacoon.
This is not only better for the kitten but also to prevent breeding from cats bought from me without prior 
permission. Only the best cats are sold for breeding and the breeding ethics of the GCCF and TICA must be followed. 
You may pay extra for a breeding cat to have the legal right to breed and the cat is placed upon the breeding 
register as opposed to the non-active register. I rarely sell for breeding.

### Viewing kittens

To keep kittens healthy, they may be viewed after their first vaccination from 10 weeks of age. 
All visits are by appointment only. Pictures will be provided at least every 4 weeks when a kitten is reserved. 
If the opportunity arises, I will send more often but this is not always possible as time is spent socializing 
with the kittens as opposed to taking photos. Please remember kittens are raised around family life.

Before a visit and when I provide my address for you, I expect you to do the same and this is checked for 
security reasons. If you would like to discuss a current kitten, please contact me - details are on the contact 
me page.
