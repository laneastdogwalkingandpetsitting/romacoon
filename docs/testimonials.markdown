> "We have purchased a number of maine coon kittens from Karen over the years. All of them have been a wonderful addition to 
our home and Karen has always been there if we needed help or advice. Thank you Karen so much!" - Hannah

> "Karen produces the finest Mainecoon babies. We have had the pleasure of having four Romacoons. Beautiful healthy babies who have 
the most beautiful temperaments and look stunning!" - Stephen

> "We have had 2 kittens from Karen, from 2 different litters and we couldn't be happier. Gus and Luna are fantastic cats, 
so well socialised and a credit to Karen's breeding. She invited us into her home to meet the kittens and meet the parents 
and sent us numerous updates until they were old enough to leave mum. We highly recommend her and would have a houseful of 
cats from Karen if we could!!" - Tamsin

> "Karen is the best breeder you could ask for. Not only is she the breeder of my two beautiful girls, Karen and her family have become friends.  
Karen gave both by girls the best start in life, with love, affection and the best homely environment anyone could ask for, really becoming one of their family.
Karen let me visit my two girls as often as I wanted when they were too young to leave their Mum, and to be able to create that bond with them was priceless."

> "My first girl (now 10!), struggled with illness at the start of her life, and Karen hand fed her and gave her so much love she has been a strong and healthy cat. 
My second cat is confident and needy for love, all thanks to Karen and her amazing breeding. 
I will be forever grateful to Karen for the two beautiful girls she bred that have become a huge part of my family" - Heather

> "Karen is an excellent and caring breeder who is totally dedicated to the welfare of her cats and kittens. It was a pleasure 
to purchase my beautiful Sansa (add proper name) from her some years ago. I would thoroughly recommend her to you as a breeder." - Jackie
