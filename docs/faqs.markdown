### Visiting kittens
I welcome people who view the kittens, but there are some simple precautions I need to ask you to take to 
prevent the spreading of feline infections to ensure the health of my cats is maintained and this is on the 
advice of my vet:

Please do not be offended as we will always ask you to wash your hands with hand wash PRIOR to touching any 
cats or kittens

Please do not visit another cattery or view other cats on the same day as you visit me, as this oftens results in 
infection being spread. If you have visited other cats the day before, please wear new clean clothing as well. 
If you have your own cats, please wear clean clothes to minimise infection.

### Reserving kittens
You may reserve your kitten before viewing as I am not able to hold kittens. A &pound;200 deposit is required to hold your 
kitten. Deposits are not refundable unless I am unable to provide you with the kitten or a replacement within 
a reasonable time. A kitten will not be classed as reserved until a deposit is received. If payment does not 
clear the kitten will be made available to the next person on the waiting list. I reserve the right to refuse 
sale with no explanation.

	writing that any illness was contracted prior to the sale date, the breeder shall refund the purchase price upon return of the kitten to the breeder.
