Hello & welcome to Romacoon

My name is Karen Hancock I am a small hobby breeder based in Bristol. I am a committee member of The Maine Coon Cat Club and the Maine Coon BAC  (Breed advisory committee). I have been breeding these majestic cats since 2008. 

I am dedicated to breeding healthy, well socialized & confident maine coon kittens which are bred to breed standard. My cats / kittens are raised in a home environment â€“ Here they are lavished with the upmost care love and attention.

My cattery is registered with GCCF & TICA 

All of my breeding cats have been health tested and are clear from HCM,SMA,PKdef, PKD & FELV/FIV. This is very important to be being a retired qualified veterinary nurse in excess of 20 years.
